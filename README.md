# Web Response Time App
This application's purpose is to run simultaneous user experience tests on many websites to measure
the time it takes to load pages and/or functions of the websites defined in the configuration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

#### Notes
I have only used this application on Windows. I am sure that it can be changed slightly to be
compatible with *nix and MacOS. I do not know for sure.

There are a few hard coded directories that can easily be changed.

The configuration update does not work very well.
